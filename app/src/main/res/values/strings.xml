    <string name="question1">Q. What is WatSights?</string>
    <string name="answer1">Our core idea is to try and make sure that you do cover up majority of those important messages and let internet be less harsh on you.</string>
    <string name="question2">Q. How does it work?</string>
    <string name="answer2">WatSights scans your message notifications and stores them locally in a database on your device. This database is only accessible to you through this app and no one (not even other apps on your phone) has access to those messages. When someone sends you a message, you get a notification. This app reads the text in the notification and determines if the message is important or not using keywords. It searches for possible combinations like links, phone numbers, email addresses, meeting links, etc.
Similarly it listens for media changes when a new media is added on your phone and if the media is deleted, it is copied in a folder on your phone. So even if the person deletes it, you still have access to that media.</string>
    <string name="question3">Q. Who are elite members</string>
    <string name="answer3">Elite members are those who you think are important and don’t want to miss their messages. Select important contacts as Elite Members and directly view their messages</string>
    <string name="question4">Q. Who are spammers?</string>
    <string name="answer4">Spammers are those people who spam a lot of messages and their messages are not so important.</string>
    <string name="question5">Q. Why do you need notification access?</string>
    <string name="answer5">The main objective of this app is to filter out important messages from the spam ones. In order to read those messages, this app requires notification access.</string>
    <string name="question6">Q. Why do you need storage access?</string>
    <string name="answer6">This app lets you to view Whatsapp media and delete pointless stickers and gifs, we need access to manage your data. This does not let the app delete anything without your permission</string>
    <string name="question7">Q. Can you see my messages?</string>
    <string name="answer7">WatSights scans your message notifications and stores them locally in a database on your device. This database is only accessible to you through this app and no one (not even other apps on your phone) has access to those messages. You can even turn on biometrics to prevent unauthoried access to those messages</string>
